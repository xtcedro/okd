        <h2>📜 About Pedro M. Dominguez 🌟</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, I’m <strong>Pedro M. Dominguez</strong>, the founder of <strong>Dominguez Tech Solutions</strong> and <strong>OK Devs</strong>. Born in Mexico, my journey brought me to Oklahoma City on December 19, 1999, a place I’ve called home ever since. 🌟
        </p>
        <p>
            After graduating from Emerson High School 🎓, I entered the workforce with determination and resilience. My experience working at McDonald’s 🍔 taught me discipline and instilled a strong work ethic that drives me to this day. But my true passion has always been technology—finding innovative ways to empower individuals and businesses. 💻✨
        </p>
        <p>
            My Catholic faith ✝️ is the cornerstone of my life, inspiring me to lead with integrity, compassion, and service. Rooted in the teachings of Christ, I strive to use technology as a tool to uplift others, reflecting the values of stewardship, innovation, and community. ❤️
        </p>
        <p>
            Through <strong>Dominguez Tech Solutions</strong>, I specialize in designing user-friendly websites 🌐, solving complex technical problems 🔧, and delivering secure IT solutions to local businesses. <strong>OK Devs</strong> builds on this foundation by offering a network of collaborative innovation, supporting small and medium-sized businesses across Oklahoma. 🚀
